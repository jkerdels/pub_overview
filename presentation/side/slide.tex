\justifying

In a casual conversation with {\bf Prof. Kai Kunze} from Keio University (Japan)
we developed the idea that we could use {\bf eye tracking on mobile devices} to 
make ``shoulder surfing'' more difficult and thus enhance the privacy in
crowded, public spaces.

\vspace{1em}
The main idea consists in {\bf obfuscating the screen content} in those areas, 
{\bf where the user is currently not looking}. 

\vspace{1em}
In~\cite{Ragozin2019} students of Prof. Kunze investigated the idea by 
implementing a prototype and conducting a pilot study.
