As an undergraduate I participated in a yearlong {\bf robotics project} in which

Our technical report~\cite{Dahm2004} provides an in-depth look into the core
challenges of teaching robots to play soccer, the solutions developed by our

As part of the GermanTeam -- a collaboration between the universities of Berlin,
