We developed a {\bf decentral scheduling algorithm} that allows multiple robots 
to coordinate their behavior to achieve a common goal in a challenging, dynamic 
environment where communication might be intermittent and the number of robots 
might change without prior notice.

Characteristics of our approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item synchronization free
	\item low-bandwidth broadcast communication
	\item graceful degradation in case of
	\begin{itemize}
		\item communication outages
		\item loss of team members
	\end{itemize}
	\item continuous replanning
\end{itemize}

The scheduling algorithm was successfully used during the RoboCup 2004 
competition winning the Standard Platform League Open Challenge.\vid{publications/2004-02/robocup04-gt_open_challenge.mp4}
