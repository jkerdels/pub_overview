\vspace{0.5em}
The cortex of mammals has a distinct, low-level structure consisting of six 
horizontal layers that are vertically connected by local groups of about 80 to 
100 neurons forming so-called {\bf minicolumns}.

\vspace{1em}
Based on our previous efforts to model the behaviour of entorhinal grid cells 
we argue in ~\cite{Kerdels2018} that a single {\bf cortical column} can function
as an independent, {\bf autoassociative memory cell} (AMC) that utilizes a 
sparse distributed encoding.

\vspace{1em}
In~\cite{Kerdels2019b} we develop our ideas further and argue that {\bf cortical 
memory is a distributed, dynamic process} that is an intrinsic part of the 
cortical network both structurally and functionally.

In~\cite{Kerdels2020} we revisit the algorithm underlying our grid cell model
and present an {\bf efficient approximation} of the original algorithm that is 
more robust regarding the formation of the groupâ€™s input space representation, 
is structurally less complex, and is computationally more efficient.
