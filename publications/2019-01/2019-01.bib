  Abstract                 = {Grid cells of the entorhinal cortex provide a rare view on the deep stages of information processing in the mammalian brain. Complementary to earlier grid cell models that interpret the behavior of grid cells as specialized parts within a system for navigation and orientation we developed a grid cell model that facilitates an abstract computational perspective on the behavior of these cells. Recently, we investigated the ability of our model to cope with increasing levels of input signal noise as it would be expected to occur in natural neurobiological circuits. Here we investigate these results further and introduce a new noise compensation mechanism to our model that normalizes the output activity of simulated grid cells irrespective of whether or not input noise is present. We present results from an extended series of simulation runs to characterize the involved parameters.},
