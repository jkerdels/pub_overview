  Abstract                 = {Killian et al. were the first to report on entorhinal neurons in primates that show grid-like firing patterns in response to eye movements. We recently demonstrated that these visual grid cells can be modeled with our RGNG-based grid cell model. Here we revisit our previous approach and develop a more comprehensive encoding of the presumed input signal that incorporates binocular movement information and fixation points that originate from a three-dimensional environment. The resulting volumetric firing rate maps exhibit a peculiar structure of regularly spaced activity columns and provide the first model-based prediction on the expected activity patterns of visual grid cells in primates if their activity were to be correlated with fixation points from a three-dimensional environment.},
