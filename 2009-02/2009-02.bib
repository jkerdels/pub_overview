  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a multi layered control architecture for hydraulic deep-sea manipulators. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Schilling Robotics Orion7P manipulator as example for a widely used deep-sea manipulator. In a number of experiments the improved precision of the new controller is shown. As application example for this improved precision the automated plugging of a deep-sea connector was evaluated and implemented.},
